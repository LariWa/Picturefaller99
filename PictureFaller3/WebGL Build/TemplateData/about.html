        The project „When Science Connects with Games“ has been developed as a part of the curriculum of University for Applied Science Berlin (HTW Berlin).<br> The project has started as a possible answer to the problem of manual testing of
        image sorting algorithms – it is very difficult to make real humans choose the same images over and over again.<br>
        It is also, of course, not possible to measure how good the algorithms are with brute force.<br>
        In order to have a good understanding of what works for human eye, one also needs to test the algorithms with real people. <br>
        The game`s premise is a dream world, where in order to continue dreaming, the player needs to solve little riddles – this is where the testing comes into play.
        <br> The project has been designed to make the boring task engaging and, possibly, positively addictive for the players. The project has been presented on a Showtime fair and the person that has managed to solve the most puzzles, has won a prize.
        <br> The game has been created by seven students of International Media and Computing: Andreas Wiedl, Jodie Preuß, Larissa Wagnerberger, Mert Sevindik, Nikolas Joop, Tayeeb Hussain and Veronika Bondarenko.
        <br> The team of seven has delegated different tasks to smaller teams (2-3 people) in order to work fast and efficiently. The development process has lasted for a semester (4 months) and has been supervised by Professor Kai-Uwe Barthel and Konstantin Schall.
